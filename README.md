### to compile

I like to use `latexmk`. Just run

    latexmk -xelatex -interaction="nonstopmode" cover.tex
    latexmk -xelatex -interaction="nonstopmode" titlepage.tex

in the respective folders.
If you don't have `latexmk` just compile like you would any LaTeX file, but with the `xelatex` engine.

### cover

This is only an approximate translation of the (PowerPoint) cover template into LaTeX. I think it looks nice.  
Things to consider:

   - edit where it says *%%% CHANGE THIS %%%*
   - go through and edit the LaTeX if you don't like how something looks, it's not that complicated hopefully


### titlepage

Again, this is only an approximate translation of the template into LaTeX. 
Things to consider:

   - edit where it says *%%% CHANGE THIS %%%*
   - go through and edit the LaTeX if you don't like how something looks, it's not that complicated hopefully
   - add your own image!




I will get in touch with FCUP to see if they consider using this as a general template.

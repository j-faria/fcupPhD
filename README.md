### Update 30/08/2019

- Part of this template is now on Overleaf [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zvxhhxynwpkg).

---

Abstract: up to 200 words  
Need to add keywords


### to compile

I like to use `latexmk`. Just run

    latexmk -xelatex -interaction="nonstopmode" cover.tex
    latexmk -xelatex -interaction="nonstopmode" titlepage.tex

in the respective folders.
If you don't have `latexmk` just compile like you would any LaTeX file, but with the `xelatex` engine.

Please, open an [issue](https://github.com/j-faria/fcupPhD/issues) if you run into problems.


### cover

This is only an approximate translation of the (PowerPoint) cover template into LaTeX. I think it looks nice.  
Things to consider:

   - edit where it says *%%% CHANGE THIS %%%*
   - go through and edit the LaTeX if you don't like how something looks, it's not that complicated hopefully


### titlepage

Again, this is only an approximate translation of the template into LaTeX. 
Things to consider:

   - edit where it says *%%% CHANGE THIS %%%*
   - go through and edit the LaTeX if you don't like how something looks, it's not that complicated hopefully
   - add your own image!


### CD

You guessed it, this is only an approximate translation of the template into LaTeX. 

   - edit where it says *%%% CHANGE THIS %%%*
   - go through and edit the LaTeX if you don't like how something looks



I will get in touch with FCUP to see if they consider using this as a general template.
